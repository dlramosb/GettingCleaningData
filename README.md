The project of the course of Getting And Cleaning Data

For this project, we need to do ->

# Objectives of the homework:

 1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
    for each measurement
 3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
 4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
     variable for each activity and each subject.

# Instructions to run the script:

1. Put the directory UCI HAR DATASET from this zip file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip in the same directory of the script run_analysis.R
2. Open R or Rstudio, and source it (source(run_analysis.R)) and it will generate a file called tidy_data.txt.
